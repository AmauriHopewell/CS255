System Analysis and Design:

This project showcases the design steps for DriverPass, an app for a local driving school designed to bring Driver's Ed into the 21st century. The app was intended to make scheduling appointments easier for students, provide them with up-to-date rules from the DMV for studying, allow access to lessons, and allow instructors to take notes on their progress, both online and offline. 

I believe one thing I did particularly well on this project was pay attention to security features. Even though this might not seem like a security-intensive project, the app will likely need to allow students to pay for their lessons using it, and so security is important. To do this, I focused on implementing a password and email login system, with methods to defeat brute-force attacks, namely an automatic lockout after 3 attempts. In addition, I emphasized the importance of up-to-date infrastructure, particularly server hosting software. 

If I could choose on part of my work to redo, I believe it would be the use case diagram. While this includes the most important user interactions from an experience standpoint, it neglects the business standpoint, and DriverPass ultimately is running a business. In particular, I would update it to include banks and payment processors as actors. 

To interpret and implement the user's needs, I first did the basics of translating their desired functionality into user-story like descriptions, and translated those to technical requirements. However, beyond that, I also thought of how these might be improved in case the user did not have a full description, adding extra robustness and security. It is important to consider the user's needs in writing software because ultimately, most software is not just an exercise in technical excellence, but a response to a real business problem or an attempt to seize on a business opportunity. Focusing on the user's needs ensures that the software performs these objectives and draws in repeat customers. 

I approach software design by using the agile methodology if at all possible, because it helps ensure customer needs are put first, breaks the software down into manageable chunks while allowing for flexibility, and encourages regular communication with the ultimate customer or user. I have also found the use of UML diagramming particularly helpful, and I believe this is a technique that meshes well with Agile, so I will be performing this in my future software development.
